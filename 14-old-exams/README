This bundle contains old questions from prior editions in ADPRO. Starting 2021
the exams are presented in Scala 3, using scala-cli, so they are similar to
present editions of the course.

Over time the topics in the course have been changing slightly, so some old
exam questions are not relevant.  If in doubt about a particular question, ask
in discord.
