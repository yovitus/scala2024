  /* Task 9. Imagine that we want to model as a lazy stream a data access

   * force one element (say downloading from a remote location) but it is
   * relatively faster to take elements in batches of k (k is a small natural
   * number), as the cost of transmission is dominated by the cost of
   * establishing the connection.
   *
   * To treat such data effciently in a lazy stream we can model this as a
   * stream of type Stream[List[A]], where each list in the stream has k
   * elements fetched.  Now forcing one element of the string will load (buffer)
   * the entire list of k elements.  However, it is inconvenient to program with
   * streams of lists, if the rest of the program logic needs to process the
   * elements of type A one-by-one.
   *
   * Implement a function flatten that converts a Stream[List[A]] to a Stream[A]
   * in the obious way (as if the lists where 'concatenated into a single
   * stream').  Do so carefully, to avoid forcing the next list in the stream if
   * not necessary.  It is fine to force the head of the stream always (as often
   * done earlier in the course), but do not force deeper elements.

  // appear because we are using fpinscala.Streams in this file, but standard
  // Library immutable lists (obviously standard library does not provide
  // toStream for our fpinscala Streams).
  //
  // A similar trick, but using a convenience constructor:
  //
  // def flatten1 [A] (s: =>Stream[List[A]]) :Stream[A] = s flatMap[A] (l => Stream(l: _*))
