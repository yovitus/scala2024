  // see whether it is tail recursive or not).
  //
  // The above solution happens to be tail recursive.  The tail recursive call
  // is marked with a "<< TL" comment on the right end of the line.  The call is
  // tail recursive because it is in the, so called, tail position (so the value
  // returned by ck in the above line, is also directly the value of the calling
  // function)
  //
  // Note: There are solutions not using recursion (for example delegating to
  // foldLeft). In such case it is OK to say that the function is not recursive
  // at all, so it is not tail recursive.

     * simplicity zero should not be used anywhere in the tree, besides the
     * root).
     *
     * The zero-trees would have to  have a failing node (for instance exception
     * thrown) just  under the  zero node,  to ensure  that whenever a
     * computation enforces them, should crash.

     * would timeout them.

     * any zero node is, well, zero.

     * For terminating tests we want to establish whether the function produces
     * a correct value.  This can be achieved by either using fixed test cases
     * with known multiplication result, or a generator that takes the node
     * values from a given random list of numbers.  In the latter case  a simple
     * oracle function can be computed by folding the multiplication monoid over
     * the list.
     *
     * I would decide that the testing is sufficient by checking whether I have
     * a decent branch coverage.  Otherwise, I would add unit tests to reach
     * untested lines.

     * COMMENTARY: Important components of a perfect answer: naming the test
     * method (property, unit, scenario ... -- you choose), test selection
     * criteria, stating sufficiency condition for testing, addressing eagerness
     * testing, specifying correctness oracle (not only for the zero case, but
     * also for the non-zero case).
