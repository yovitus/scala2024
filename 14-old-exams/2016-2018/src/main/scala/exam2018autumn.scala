  Final Exam: Advanced Programming (Master-Level, MSc-Level)

  Your Full Name: ___
  Your ITU email account: ___

  The exam consists of 10 tasks to  be solved within 4 hours.  MSc and
  Master students  (so all  registered) solve the  same exam,  all the
  tasks.   You  can  use  any  function  from  the  course  (textbook,
  exercises) in the solutions, as  well as standard library functions,
  unless stated otherwise in the question.  You can access any written
  or electronic  materials, also  online, but you  are not  allowed to
  communicate with anybody during the exam.

  By  submitting,  you declare  to  have  solved the  problems  alone,
  without communicating with anybody.



  SUBMISSION

  Solve the tasks in the file 'exam2018autumn.scala' (this file) found
  in the zip archive made available on LearnIt.

  Fill in your name and your ITU email above, in the top of the file.

  Submit this file  and only this file to learnIT.   Do not convert it
  to  any other  format than  .scala.  Do  not submit  the entire  zip
  archive. Do  not reorder  the answers,  and do  not remove  question
  numbers from the  file.  When free text answers  are expected, write
  them as comments.

  The only accepted file format is '.scala'.

  The  answers  will   be  graded  manually. We  will   focus  on  the
  correctness of ideas and the use  of the course concepts. We will be
  permissive on  minor issues  such as semicolons,  other punctuation,
  small deviations  in function  names, switching between  curried and
  uncurried  parameters, etc.   We  will not  check  whether the  type
  inference  succeeds. It suffices  that  a human  reader could  infer
  types.



  REMARKS

  Each  task has  some introduction  text. The part  that needs  to be
  solved is marked with the letter 'Q'.

  We do not recommend solving questions to the point when they compile
  and pass tests.  Dependency problems  and other technical issues can
  take a lot of time, so only do this, once you are done with drafting
  all answers.

  Nevertheless, if  you do compile,  you can use the  'build.sbt' file
  provided  in the  zip  archive linked  above. It  has the  necessary
  library dependencies  configured. The file also contains  the course
  libraries that the solutions depend on.

  Some values are made lazy  so prevent your executions failing before
  all exercises are solved (this is  too help you running in the REPL,
  or  testing otherwise.   Otherwise  these lazy  annotations have  no
  addition meaning.

  Good luck!

   *  :Deque[B] def empty: Boolean def nonEmpty: Boolean def headL :A def tailL

   *
   *  This interface is implemented by our FingerTrees in the course (and the
   *  FingerTrees module in this zip bundle has been slightly adjusted to make
   *  this interface explicit).
   *
   *  We want to obtain a new Deque implementation by combination: it takes two
   *  deques and presents them as a single one. For example it takes two Finger
   *  Trees and presents them as a single one.  The idea is to interleave the
   *  two incoming deques, taking elements from them, or putting into them in
   *  alternation.   So if you insert elements in sequence on the left, they are
   *  put interchangebly either in the first or the second combined deque.
   *  Similarly for removal.
   *
   *  For this we need to remember which one of the aggregated deques is active.
   *  We store it in the third parameter of the combinator constructor below
   *  (this.first_active). Initially the first argument deque is active,by
   *  default.
   *
   *  Study the implementation below until you reach the question text.

    /* Task 10. REASONING ABOUT PERSISTENT DATA STRUCTURE DESIGN
     *
     * The above implementation of deque uses one state variable (first_active)
     * to store which deque is active. First_active is switched approximately at
     * every operation. However this means that if we add and remove elements
     * from the combined deque in precise alternation, we will always be adding
     * to one deque, and always removing from the other (at least until it does
     * not deplete).  This is not a very interleaving strategy.  One way to fix
     * it, is to add another state variable to distinguish which of the combined
     * deques is active for adding, and which for removing separately.
     *
     * Q. Describe in English what changes would be required to the above
     * implementation of head and tail functions to accommodate this change. Do
     * not write the implementations in Scala. Indicative answer size is between
     * 50 and 200 words.
