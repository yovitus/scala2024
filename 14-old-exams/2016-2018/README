There are three exam sets:

1. Exam 2018 Autumn is in src/main/scala/exam2018autumn.scala . This was the first time
   when the entire exam text has been placed inside the .scala file.
   The same format will be used in 2019.

2. exam2018.scala.pdf from 2018 spring (along with the corresponding
   exam2018.scala file and, spoiler alert, exam2018solutions.scala file).


3. exam2017.scala.pdf from 2017 (along with the corresponding exam2017.scala
   file and, spoiler alert, exam2017solutions.scala file).

4. exam2016.scala.pdf from 2016 (along with the corresponding exam2016.scala
   file and, spoiler alert, exam2016solutions.scala file).

5. src/main/scala/examFake.scala (along with the corresponding solutions).
   This is a trial exam prepared in 2016.  It has the same scope and size as an
   actual exam. This one was never typeset in the PDF file, but all the questions
   are in comments in the scala file (like in Autumn 2018).

The build.sbt file and the library implementation files for these exams.

The solutions are always a bit sketchy, sometimes even imperfect, mostly
created to assess feasibility.  Contact teachers via forums if in doubt.
Extremely many other solutions are often possible.
