/************************************************************************
  Final Exam: Advanced Programming (Master-Level, MSc-Level)
  IT University of Copenhagen, Autumn 2019: 16 December 9:00

 ************************************************************************

  Your Full Name: ___
  Your ITU email account: ___

  The exam consists of 3 parts encompassing 15 qpuestions to be solved
  within 4 hours.   MSc students solve all parts.   Master of Software
  Engineering students only solve the first  2 parts.  You can use any
  function from the course (textbook,  exercises) in the solutions, as
  well as standard  library functions.  You can access  any written or
  electronic  materials,  also online,  but  you  are not  allowed  to
  communicate with anybody during the exam.

  By  submitting,  you declare  to  have  solved the  problems  alone,
  without communicating with anybody.



  SUBMISSION

  Solve the tasks in the file 'Exam2019Autumn.scala' (this file) found
  in the zip archive made available on LearnIt.

  Fill in your name and your ITU email above, in the top of the file.

  Submit this file  and only this file to learnIT.   Do not convert it
  to  any other  format than  .scala.  Do  not submit  the entire  zip
  archive. Do  not reorder  the answers,  and do  not remove  question
  numbers from the  file.  When free text answers  are expected, write
  them as comments.

  The only accepted file format is '.scala'.

  The  answers  will   be  graded  manually. We  will   focus  on  the
  correctness of ideas and the use  of the course concepts. We will be
  permissive on  minor issues  such as semicolons,  other punctuation,
  small deviations  in function  names, switching between  curried and
  uncurried  parameters, etc.   We  will not  check  whether the  type
  inference  succeeds. It suffices  that  a human  reader could  infer
  types.



  ADVICE

  We do not recommend solving questions to the point when they compile
  and pass tests.  Dependency problems  and other technical issues can
  take a lot of time, so only do this, once you are done with drafting
  all answers.

  Nevertheless, if  you do compile,  you can use the  'build.sbt' file
  provided  in the  zip  archive linked  above. It  has the  necessary
  library dependencies  configured. The zip archive also  contains the
  course libraries that the solutions depend on.

  Some values are made lazy  so prevent your executions failing before
  all exercises are solved (this is  too help you running in the REPL,
  or  testing otherwise.   Otherwise  these lazy  annotations have  no
  addition meaning.

  Good luck!
