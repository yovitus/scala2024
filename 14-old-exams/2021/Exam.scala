/********************************
 * Final Exam: Advanced Programming by Andrzej WÄ…sowski
 * IT University of Copenhagen, Autumn 2020: 10 January 2022, 15:00
 *
 * The exam consists of 13 questions to be solved within 4 hours.
 *
 * You can use  any function from the course  (textbook, exercises) in
 * the solutions, as  well as  standard library  functions.  You  can
 * access any written or electronic material, also online, but you are
 * not allowed to communicate with anybody.  By  submitting, you
 * legally declare to have solved the problems alone, without
 * communicating with anybody.
 *
 * Solve the tasks in the file 'Exam.scala' (this file) found in the
 * zip archive made available on LearnIt.
 *
 * Submit this file and only this file to learnIT. Do not convert to
 * any other format than .scala.  Do not submit the entire zip
 * archive. Do not  reorder the  answers, and  do not  remove question
 * numbers from the file.  The only accepted file format is '.scala'.
 *
 * Keep the solutions within 80 columns width to make grading easier.
 *
 * The  answers  will   be  graded  manually. We  focus  on  the
 * correctness of ideas, the use  of concepts, clarity, and style. We
 * are permissive on minor issues  such as semicolons,  commas, other
 * punctuation, small deviations  in function  names, switching
 * between  curried and not curried arguments,  etc.  We  will not
 * check whether  the type inference succeeds.   It suffices  that a
 * human reader  could infer types.
 *
 * We do not recommend solving questions to the point when they
 * compile and pass tests.  Dependency problems  and other technical
 * issues can take a lot of time, so only do this, once you are done
 * with drafting all answers.  If  you do compile,  you can use the
 * 'build.sbt' file provided  in the  zip  archive linked  above. It
 * has the  necessary library dependencies  configured, and the
 * source files from the semester are included.
 *
 * The  percentage  at  the   beginning  of  each  question  will be
 * used as a soft indicative weight in grading.
 *
 * Good luck!

   * to mix languages in the exam.  Recall that in Java all method
   * calls are virtual, so dynamically dispatched.

   * (Left) in the input list should result in a failure overall, a
   * single Left. Otherwise return the Right values from the input

   * - And Rand as State:
   *
   *   type Rand[A] = State[RNG, A]
   *
   * In State.scala many more functions are available for RNG.Rand
   * than for State.Rand (because State is a more abstract interface
   * that can be used for other things, so it does not know that we
   * are dealing with RNG inside).  One example of such function is
   * `Rand.both`:
