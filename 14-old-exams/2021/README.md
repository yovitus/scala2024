Start in 'Exam.scala'

The exam was designed for the 1ed of 'Functional Programming in Scala',
and then converted to Scala 3, so there are minor discrepancies from
the current exposition of the 2ed of the book.  The main point is
noted in a comment.

The files originally provided for the exam are `Exam.scala`
`Exam.test.scala` plus the files listed in the next paragraph.

CREDITS: The files `Foldable.scala`, `Gen.scala`, `LazyList.scala`,
`Monad.scala`, `Monoid.scala`, `Par.scala`, `Parsers.scala`, `State.scala` come
from the text book repository (fpinscala 2nd edition).  They have been
slightly trimmed, to reduce dependencies on filesnot included.

The following files contain example solutions and some tests:
`Exam.solution.scala`, `Exam.solution.test.scala`. These have not been
available to students during the exam.

If you want to have an exam as similar as possible to the one
presented in 2021 (but in Scala 3), delete all files with 'solution'
in the name without looking.
