/************************************************************************
 * Final Exam: Advanced Programming by Andrzej WÄ…sowski
 * IT University of Copenhagen, Autumn 2020: 6 January 2021, 9:00
 *
 * Your Full Name: ___
 * Your ITU email account: ___
 *
 * The exam consists of 9 questions to be solved within 4 hours.
 *
 * It is possible  to answer later questions, missing  the answers for
 * the previous ones, but it is recommended to answer in order.
 *
 * You can use  any function from the course  (textbook, exercises) in
 * the  solutions, as  well as  standard library  functions.  You  can
 * access any written or electronic material, also online, but you are
 * not allowed to communicate with anybody during the exam.
 *
 * By  submitting, you  declare  to have  solved  the problems  alone,
 * without communicating with anybody.
 *
 * SUBMISSION
 *
 * Solve the tasks in the file 'Exam2020Autumn.scala' (this file) found
 * in the zip archive made available on LearnIt.
 *
 * Fill in your name and your ITU email above, in the top of the file.
 *
 * Submit this file and only this  file to learnIT.  Do not convert to
 * any  other  format than  .scala.   Do  not  submit the  entire  zip
 * archive. Do not  reorder the  answers, and  do not  remove question
 * numbers from the file.  The only accepted file format is '.scala'.
 *
 * Keep the solutions within 80 columns width to make grading easier.
 *
 * ADVICE
 *
 * The  answers  will   be  graded  manually. We  will   focus  on  the
 * correctness of ideas and the use  of the course concepts. We will be
 * permissive on  minor issues  such as semicolons,  other punctuation,
 * small deviations  in function  names, switching between  curried and
 * not  curried arguments,  etc.  We  will not  check whether  the type
 * inference succeeds.   It suffices  that a  human reader  could infer
 * types.
 *
 * We do not recommend solving questions to the point when they compile
 * and pass tests.  Dependency problems  and other technical issues can
 * take a lot of time, so only do this, once you are done with drafting
 * all answers.
 *
 * Nevertheless, if  you do compile,  you can use the  'build.sbt' file
 * provided  in the  zip  archive linked  above. It  has the  necessary
 * library dependencies  configured. The zip archive also  contains the
 * course libraries that the solutions depend on.
 *
 * The  percentage  at  the   beginning  of  each  question  indicates
 * difficulty of the question, and will be used as guide in grading.
 *
 * Good luck!

     * TYPE CLASSES AND TYPE CONSTRAINTS

     * Another way to  handle errors in smash is to  make the function
     * total.  This could be done by assuming that the element type is
     * 'splittable', so  that we can split  an element in half,  if we
     * are left with an odd one.
     *
     * For example, let's  imagine that a Float can  be split dividing
     * the  value  into  two.   Then  smash  could  be  producing  the
     * following:
     *
     *   smash (List[Double] (1,2,3)) == List (1 -> 2, 1.5 -> 1.5)
     *
     * For this we need to assume  that the type variable A represents
     * a splittable type.   Let's say that a type is  splittable if it
     * has an instance of the type class Splittable implemented by the
     * following trait:
